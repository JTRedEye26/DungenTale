# DungenTale

This was a school project I made in 2018 in grade 12 with 2 other guys and was the first big project I was ever a part of.

Dungeon is spelt wrong because we started coding and didn't realize the mistake until it was too much of a hassle to change so we said it was a creative choice.

The game is not finished and some features are broken due to time, but you can play around with it for a while before it crashes.
