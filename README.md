# DungenTale
This was a school project I made in 2018 in grade 12 with 2 other guys and was the first big project I was ever apart of.

Dungeon is spelt wrong becuase we started coding and didn't relize the mistake until it was too much of a hassle to change so we said it was a creative choice.

The game is not finished and some fetures are broken due to time but you can play around with it for a while before it crashes.
